Hi! I'm **Nivekithan S**, a backend developer with 3 years of experience in building scalable web applications and APIs.

## Professional Experience

I'm currently working at [epyc.in](https://epyc.in) as a backend developer.

## Technical Skills

### Backend Development

- **Runtime**: Node.js, Cloudflare Workers
- **Language**: TypeScript (primary)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (both professional and personal projects)

### Frontend Collaboration

While I consider myself primarily a backend developer, I also contribute to frontend development:

- Restructuring React code to minimize unnecessary re-rendering
- Removing unnecessary `useEffect` hooks following [React's best practices](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)
- Ensuring proper React Query revalidation and caching strategies

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is where I share my experiences, learnings, and tutorials about backend development, database management, and the occasional frontend insights. Expect posts about PostgreSQL, Node.js, TypeScript, and web development best practices.
